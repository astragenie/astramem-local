## Per-slice findings
### [LOW] subagent-overuse
- 3 subagent dispatches.
- **Suggested action:** Subagents cold-start with no cache reuse — each one re-derives session context. Reserve for genuinely independent parallel work.

### [HIGH] compaction
- 6 compaction/meta event(s) — context was summarised mid-slice.
- **Suggested action:** Slice ran past the context window. Checkpoint to a handoff artifact earlier and split the work.

### [HIGH] exploration-heavy
- Exploration:execution tool ratio is 32.8:1 (Reads/Greps/Bashes vs Edits/Writes).
- **Suggested action:** Lots of looking, little doing. After the second exploration pass, write the plan down and start editing; do not keep grepping. Prefer LSP for code-symbol lookups (see `docs/process/grep-guidance.md` in hero-crew); use Grep only for prose, configs, or regex hunts.

### [MEDIUM] xrepo-attribution
- Cost was auto-attributed to C--work-mega-astramem-local (not the repo-derived dir). Single-source view may under-count if work spanned multiple sessions.
- **Suggested action:** Re-run cost-slice with --aggregate-all to capture cross-repo spend, or pass --source-project explicitly if you know the right slug.
